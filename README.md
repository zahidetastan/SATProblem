Boolean satisfiability problem 

Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is evaluating given boolean equation for its satisfiability. A SAT
solver will return any satisfying instance of variables if the equation is satisfiable otherwise will return
‘UNSAT’, short for equation is unsatisfiable. 

In this project, solve satisfiability problem where inputs given in DIMACS CNF format. Program will accept boolean
expressions with any number of variable and any number of
clause in DIMACS CNF format from “input.cnf” file.
Result will be printed into “output.cnf” formats.
